# CONFIGURING THE TOKEN SMART CONTRACT

Our dApp uses a reward token that follows a standard. Launching a token on Koinos is easy and discussed in Module 6.

We can simply clone the token contract standard and rename our token. Build the contract as mentioned in Module 6 and upload it to a wallet address and use that address initialize the gamestat contract!

Simple!
