# Introduction to Smart Contracts

## Prerequisites

- Install the `koinos-sdk-as-cli` from [MODULE 4: YOUR FIRST CONTRACT WITH KOINOS-SDK-AS-CLI](/modules/M4/1_introduction)

- Review databases from [MODULE 6: LAUNCH A TOKEN WITH THE KOINOS-SDK-AS-CLI](/modules/M6/1_introduction).

- Review the usage of `google protocol buffers` (aka `protobuf`).

  

## Outline of What to Expect:

Here is how we should generally approach the development of our code for our dApp smart contract:

1. Determine our contract entry points and use them to develop our `.proto` file.

2. Generate a boilerplate using our entry points.

3. Copy the boilerplate file and begin developing our entry point logic.
