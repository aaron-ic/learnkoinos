# Introduction To Front End

The front end of a (dApp) is a crucial component in reaching and engaging users. It serves as the most recgonizable portion of an application, making it an essential component for successful user adoption. The front end not only enables users to access the dApp but also contributes to branding and represents the quality of the overall product, for this reason it MUST BE SIMPLE!

When building the front end, the choice of framework is not as important as the proficiency and familiarity that the front end developer has with it. Using what you already know is crucial to launching a dApp in 7 days. React was selected as the framework due to our developer's experience and ease of development. You should use whatever framework is most familiar with your front end developer. There is no wrong option.

## Pitfalls to be aware of

Spending excessive time on polishing the visual appearance at the expense of the core functionality can result in a great-looking website with a subpar product, which is not desirable for an MVP item. Additionally, the front end should avoid overwhelming users with an excessive amount of information. The MVP should be intuitive and easy for users to navigate.

To expedite the development process, it can be beneficial to emulate existing interfaces that are not specific to any particular application. This approach reduces development time by leveraging off-the-shelf components.

## Mock Ups

Mocking up the front end is an important step before implementation. We used [Excalidraw](http://excalidraw.com) for quick front-end mockups. We started by throwing our ideas on excalidraw and iteratively simplified the design to create the most barebones version possible. 


## Focus on Immediate Clarity

When users use the application, they should be able to immediate understand how to interact with it. This is why the user only has to perfrom three actions, connect their wallet, select their answer and claim their reward if they win.


In summary, the front end of a dApp serves as the interface for users to access and engage with the application. It should prioritize functionality over excessive visual polish, avoid overwhelming users with information, and strive for intuitive user experience. Existing interfaces can be emulated, and mocking up the front end using tools like Excalidraw can expedite the design process.
