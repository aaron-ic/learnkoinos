# PHASE 1: THE IDEA & THE SKILLS REQUIRED

While it is acceptable to build a niche dApp, we suggest you begin with a general idea to cover the widest range of  possible users. Focus on the user's perspective and their experience and improve using their feedback!

Remember, if you can't explain it simply, then you don't understand it well enough! If you find yourself in this position, simplify your idea and try again.

Let's start!

## DEVELOPING THE IDEA:

For this module, we'll be creating a game dApp called called Fact or Fiction. 

### The User Experience:

At the end of the game, there will be only 1 winner who will recieve tokens as a reward. The user won't have to know what cryptocurrency is, nor will they need to hold any tokens to begin. The user will need to install Kondor Wallet to begin.

The game will starts with a simple question with two choices only, Fact or Fiction. If the user selects the wrong answer, they are eliminated, if they select the correct answer, they move on. The questions have varying difficulty and the last player standing wins.


## ASSEMBLE THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM:

When assembling the dev team, make sure you keep the idea simple. You'll need 3 main skills to be able to complete this challenege. If you are not a technical co-founder, don't worry you can still assemble the team because you've kept your idea simple and easy to explain!

Here's the basic skills you'll want to seek out in your potential team:

__Frontend__

Front end development will require someone with an understanding of basic Web2 development. They should know javascript and frameworks like react, angular or similar. Their goal is to create the wireframe which can interact with the backend and the smart contract entry points.

__Backend__

There is a huge variation in how backends can be created. For this example, we'll keep thing simple by using a serverless design via SupaBase. We won't cover the exact method because your flavor of backend will vary. However you will need someone who understands how to handle backend services or be prepared to build their own backend server. No Web3 knowledge is necessary to do this. It is also possible that you create your entire dApp without a Backend and leverage Koinos Blockchain as the backend. This is how dApps like [BurnKoin](https:burnkoin.com) and [KAP](https://kap.domains) operate.


__Smart Contracts__

Smart contract development is often the easiest part! The smart contract developer on Koinos must have knowledge in Type Script so they can install and use the `koinos-sdk-as-cli`. See [Developer Modules](/landing/dev) for more information.

Although it is possible that 1 person has the skill to perform all of the work, it is advisible to have atleast 2-3 people to help complete this project.

With the team assembled, its time to get everyone into a room and start architecting the dApp, which means developing the user experience (UX), so you can build tasks and assign work responsibilities.
