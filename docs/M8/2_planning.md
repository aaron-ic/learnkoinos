# PHASE 1: THE IDEA & BUILDING THE TEAM

Early founding members must have a basic idea and be able to explain it in simple terms to other potential team members. The best way we've found is to describe the idea based on the final outcome and work backward. Remember, if you can't explain it simply, then you don't understand it well enough.

The team must understand that the final product might launch with missing features and that is ok! The goal is to focus on launching and gathering user feedback so you can improve.

Let's start!

## DEVELOPING THE IDEA:

For this module, we'll be creating a game dApp called called Fact or Fiction. The outcome is simple, there are multiple players but only 1 winner will receieve the in-game reward token. The goal is to keep the concept as simple as possible so we can build the team around the idea.

## ASSEMBLE THE TEAM:

When assembling the team, share the idea but keep in mind that most dApps will require 3 main types of skills to build. If you are not a technical co-founder, don't worry you can still assemble the team because you've kept your idea simple and easy to explain!

Here's the basic skills you'll want to seek out in your potential team:

__Front End Development__

Front end development will require someone with an understanding of javascript and frameworks like react or similar. Their goal is to create the wireframe which can interact with the middleware and smart contract's entry points.

__Middle-ware__

There is a huge variation in how middleware is operated including serverless designs. Because of the wide variety available, it is difficult to label the exact skills. However in most cases, you will need someone who understands how to launch a server, manage databases, setup scripts and maintain the infrastructure.
  
__Smart Contracts__

Smart contract development is often the easiest part! The smart contract developer on Koinos must have knowledge in Type Script and using the `koinos-sdk-as-cli` which has it's own tutorial on

[Developer Modules](/landing/dev).

Although it is possible that 1 person has the skill to perform all of the work, it is advisible to have atleast 2-3 people to help complete this project.

With the team assembled, its time to get everyone into a room and start architecting the dApp, which means developing the user experience (UX), so you can build tasks and assign work responsibilities.
