# Launch a dApp in 7 days!

In this module, we'll walk you through the process of launching a successful dApp in 7 days on the Koinos blockchain. We're going to provide you with all of the knowledge necessary to pull this off using an example project called "Fact or Fiction", a trivia-type game. You should be someone who is:

1. Part of a team that is building on Koinos for the 1st time.

2. A developer or entrepreneurs who wants to understand the logistics of developing a dApp.

3. An entrepreneurs with an idea and wondering how much effort is needed to develop a dApp.


## Why 7 days? 

Most startups fail because they cant launch their product. It is either not well developed, or too complicated. The 7 day dApp is a framework to help you boil your idea into something that can be launched in 7 days. The sooner you launch, the sooner so you can can user feedback and begin iterating your idea.

This module gives you that framework and encourages you to launch quickly and generate enough momentum to be successful.

  

## How this Module is structured.


This module will break down the three major phases of work.


(i) The planning phase (approximately 1 day)

(ii) The building phase (approximately 5 days)

(iii) The deployment phase (approximately 1 day)


## Prerequisites
