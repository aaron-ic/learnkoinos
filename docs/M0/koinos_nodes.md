# Koinos Nodes

Koinos is a permisionless system which allows anyone to participate in the ecosystem, including operating a Koinos Node. Nodes can be operated on tyical hardware found on home computers or remotely with a VPS. Several mining pools (aka burn pools) also exist for users who do not wish to run a node. For the full tutorial on how to run a node, see [Running a Koinos Node](/M3/1_introduction.md).

## What is a Koinos Node?

A Koinos node performs several actions depending on its configuration. If it is setup to produce blocks, then the operator is participating in providing security to the network through block production. These nodes are typically refered to as block producer nodes and the node operator earns a reward for each block produced in the form of newly minted $KOIN.

Whenever a block is produced, transactions from the mempool are processed by the node and transmitted to the network for verification and inclusion onto local chains. These transactions may include the transfer of tokens, execution of smart contracts, governance votes and more.

Koinos nodes may also run optional microservices that can provide a live connection to the blockchain to process API calls.

## Why would someone run a Koinos node?

Running a node is a great way for existing token holders to earn more $KOIN. The yield generating from a Koinos mining node varies and is automatically managed by the network in a decentralized manner and is dependent on live network conditions.

Nodes should expect to earn anywhere from 2% - 5% depending on how they are setup
