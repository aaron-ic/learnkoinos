# Koinos Proof of Burn

The concept of burning tokens is not new to blockchain so there are many variations of Proof of Burn (PoB)  that exist on the internet. The particular variation used on Koinos was developed by Koinos Group and it is often refered to Koinos Proof of Burn or KPoB. On LearnKoinos, we refer to KPoB as simply PoB.



## Operating Principal

PoB underpins the security of the Koinos Blockchain. To participate in block production, $KOIN holders must be willing to burn some of their $KOIN to begin. Block producers will always earn more than what they burned originally. 


The basic operating principal is as follows:

1. The node operator burns $KOIN.
2. The network returns $VHP (Virtual Hash Power), a fungible token access token, to the node operator. 
3. The node attempts to meet the block production criteria. If the criteria is met, the node produces a block and transmits it to the rest of the network. $VHP is burned in this process.
4. If the block is valid, the node operator recieves more $KOIN than the amount of $VHP burned and the cycle repeats.

Ultimately, PoB is a combination of principals found in PoW and PoS. Namely the randomness of PoW is combined with the requirement to be a token holder found in PoS. But the PoB node operator must also destroy the tokens to prove commitment much like a PoW node operator must commit capital to buy mining hardware. The burn component also allows token holders to manage inflation/deflation mechanics. 

## Inflation

PoB rewards node operators through inflation. Inflation may be changed by on-chain governance. It is currently set at 2% of the Virtual Supply. Next, we'll review how the block reward is calculated from inflation.
