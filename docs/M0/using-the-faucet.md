# Using the faucet on Discord

The faucet is a method to gain free _**tKOIN**_.the Koinos blockchain testnet token. This token has no value but is necessary to test development contracts before deploying on main net.

Once you have your public address you can join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GErGNsu) server and request some _**tKOIN**_ in the `#faucet` channel by sending the following message to the faucet bot:

```
!faucet <public address>
```

Example:

```
!faucet 1ENxxuH81kytBdYe81fD9tBdYe81fD9Qxe
```

You can get your balance at any time using the command:

```
!balance <public address>
```

Example:

```
!balance 1ENxxuH81kytBdYe81fD9BdYe81fD9Qxe
```
