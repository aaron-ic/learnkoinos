A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. It allows trustworthy transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

The term "smart contract" was first proposed by computer scientist Nick Szabo in the 1990s, long before the advent of blockchain technology. However, it's with the advent of blockchain and cryptocurrencies that smart contracts really came into the mainstream.

Smart contracts are a central feature of many cryptocurrency networks and blockchain platforms, with the most significant being Ethereum. These contracts are "smart" because they are capable of executing themselves based on the coded rules and conditions within them. When certain conditions are met, the smart contract can automatically enforce the agreement it contains.

For example, consider a simple smart contract for a betting game. Two parties may bet on the outcome of a future event, like a sports game. They send their bets to the smart contract. When the event is over, the smart contract checks the result and automatically transfers the money to the winner.

Smart contracts can handle more complex situations as well, like managing decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, token creation, decentralized exchanges, and more. In essence, they are like digital vending machines, executing predefined rules and transactions based on user inputs or real-world data.

However, while smart contracts can offer efficiency, transparency, and the potential to reduce fraud, they can also be quite rigid and have their own risks. For example, once deployed, a smart contract on the Ethereum network cannot be modified, which can lead to serious issues if the original code contains bugs or security vulnerabilities.
