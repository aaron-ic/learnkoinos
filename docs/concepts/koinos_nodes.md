# Koinos Nodes

Koinos is a permisionless system which allows anyone to participate in the ecosystem. The only requirement to run a Koinos Mining node is that the miner must possess $KOIN.

Nodes can be operated on tyical hardware found on home computers. For more information on the specifications, see developer tutorials on [How to Launch a Mining Node](/modules/M3/1_introduction.md).


Several mining pools (aka burn pools) also exist for users who do not wish to run a node such as [BurnKoin](http://burnkoin.com) and various pools found within [Fogata](http://fogata.io). For the full tutorial on how to run a node, see the developer tutorials tab. 

## What is a Koinos Node?

A Koinos node performs several actions depending on its configuration. It may produce blocks which secures the network, earning the node operator newly minted $KOIN rewards. It may also be easily configured to behave as an API endpoint for direct communication with the blockchain.

Typically, dApps will transmit transactions to a specific node. These transactions are stored in a mempool and broadcasted to the network via the Peer-to-Peer microservice and then included into blocks in a first-in-first-out order.

Blocks producers compete to produce blocks and do not have any specific ordering process. Block producers are also the only participants in the ecosystem who can carry out governance votes.

## Why would someone run a Koinos node?

Running a node is a great way for existing token holders to earn more $KOIN and help secure the network. The yield generating from a Koinos mining node is a fixed percentage that is only adjustable through governance vote. See [Proof of Burn](/docs/concepts/koinos_pob.md) on how this yield is calcuated.

Mining nodes should expect to earn anywhere from 2% - 5% depending on how they are managed.
