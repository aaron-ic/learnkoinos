# Installing and Using Kondor Wallet

Kondor Wallet was created by a long standing community developer, Julian Gonzalez. He is also the founder of the [Fogata Burnpool](http://fogata.io).

Kondor Wallet is an extention for Google Chrome and Chrome-like browsers such as Brave. There is no planned mobile support.

## Installing Kondor

To install Kondor, [click here to go to the chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kondor/ghipkefkpgkladckmlmdnadmcchefhjl) and follow the instructions for installation. Once installed, you'll get a window similar to below that confirms the installation is complete. The extention is now accessible by clicking on the puzzle icon.

# Setting up Kondor

Kondor is similar to metamask, but if you've never used metamask, we'll walk you through the setup steps. Begin by clicking on the purple kondor wings which will open up Kondor for the first time. Click on `New Wallet` to begin the setup.

The next window allows you to setup Kondor using 3 methods. The first is using an existing 12 word phrase. If you have a 12 word phrase than you should already be familiar with this process. If you're using another wallet then you can use `Use Private Key` to access your existing wallet.

However, if this is the first time using any blockchain wallet, click on `New Wallet` at the bottom of the window.

This will bring you to an extremely important window! You will be presented with a `Seed Phrase` which is a collection of 12 words that is used to access a new wallet. These seed phrases can be used to access your funds so you must safe guard them. 

Our recommendation to store these seed phrases are to use a combination of the following methods:

1. Write it on a piece of paper and safe guard it from fire, theft and flood.
2. Use a steel seed phrase collector. There are several DIY and kits you can find online for purchase.
3. Keep multiple copies in different locations, in case of fire theft and flood.
4. Store them on a USB drive that is safe guarded from fire, theft and flood.

Once you've safely guarded these phrases, you'll need to check two boxes confirming you understand the importance of these phrases and provide an encryption password.

Next, you'll have to click-to-input the seed phrases. This step is designed to force you to use your record copy to ensure you've save them.

Once that is done, Kondor is fully setup, and you should be presented with a window that displays your wallet address known as `Account 0`. You'll also see your KOIN balance, whch begins at 0, and your Mana amount, which is also 0.

## Connecting and Completing Transactions

Each dApp will have it's own design, but all dApps will have a request to connect a wallet. We'll use BurnKoin as an example. Clicking on the `Connect` button will bring up the following Kondor window. Check off the account you want to connect and click accept. This process transmits your wallet address to the dApp but does not authorize any transfers of any sort.

## Approving Transactions

When connecting to a dApp, you'll need to perform a transaction. This will trigger a Kondor Transaction Window. This window has many options, but for trusted dApps, you may click `Skip` and then scroll down to click `Send`.

To see the step by step transaction events, click `Check Events`. You'll see each entry point the transaction is performing.

An `Advance` tab is also available which allows you to set `payers` and `rclimits`
