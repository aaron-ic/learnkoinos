# Launch a Token Using the Automatic Deployment Method

In Lesson 1, we used the `koinos-sdk-as-cli` to create a project called `myawesomecontract`. In this example, we will not be using the `koinos-sdk-as-cli`. Instead, we will be using a different SDK known as the `koinos-contract-as` which uses a precompiler and defines the ABI within the TS files.

The method is slightly different, but the benefit of this launcher is that the dev environment setup is easier. You will only need NodeJS.

The basic usage of this repo is as follows:

1. Clone the repo
2. Set up the deployment addressess
3. Modify the token.ts file to fit your project
4. Compile and deploy

So in just 4 steps, you can launch a token on Koinos!
