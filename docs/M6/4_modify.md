# Modify The Token Smart Contract

Enter the `contracts` folder and you will find three folders. 

- `hello` is a typical hello world smart contract. This is an example folder and you do not need to use it.
- `manasharer` is a typical Mana Sharing contract that is used to deploy the token contract into an empty wallet.
- `token` is a typical token contract that can create new tokens.

Open the file located at `/token/assembly/proto/token.ts` and scroll to line 24-27. Adjust the variables to suite your project.

If you want to make any more adjustments to the token standard, feel free to make them now.

Once you are done, save the file.
