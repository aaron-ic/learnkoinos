# Step 1: Clone the Repo

## For Linux Mac & Windows
Clone the repo into the directory of your choice using the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/koinos/koinos.git
```

This will make a folder in your chosen directory called `koinos`. Change into this directory  using the following command:

```
cd koinos
```
Once you are in the koinos directory, point to the latest version, as of this writing, this will be v2.0.0

```
git checkout v2.0.0
```
