# Sending a Token

You can also run `help` against any command to learn more about it. Notice that the command `help` always provides `Usage` instructions. Try this with the `koin.transfer` command:

```

🔐 > help koin.transfer
Transfers the token
Usage: koin.transfer <to:address> <amount:amount>

```
In this case, to use the command `koin.transfer`, you need two additional arguments, the first is the destination address, and the other is the amount of $KOIN you wish to transfer. Fill in this information and hit enter.
