# Starting a Koinos Mining Node
Koinos is permissionless and open. Anyone can run a node. To run a mining node, users must have $KOIN to produce blocks and earn block rewards. There is no node registartion cost and there is no minimum $KOIN required to begin mining. The more $KOIN you hold, the greater your chances are to produce blocks and earn rewards however users can typically expect to earn 2% to 6% depending on miner participation and node management.
