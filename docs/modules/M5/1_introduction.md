# Launching an NFT collection

This guide allows users to manually launch an NFT collection based on current [KCS-2](https://github.com/koinos/koinos-contract-standards/blob/master/KCSs/kcs-2.md) (Koinos Contract Standard) for NFTs. More information can be found directly on the [Kollection Docs](https://docs.kollection.app/docs/developers/intro)

The repo is built by the Kollections NFT team and is based on the `koinos-sdk-as`

The basic usage of this repo is as follows:

1. Clone and install the repo
2. Modify the contents of collections.ts to fit your NFT project
3. Compile and gather the `.wasm` and  `.abi` files.
4. Manually deploy to the Koinos main net.
