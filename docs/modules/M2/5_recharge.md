# What happens after you use Mana?

Consuming Mana causes the $KOIN tokens in your wallet to be temporarily locked. Just like our car anology, if you ran out of juice in your electric car, you're going to have to sit and wait until it recharges enough to get you going again.

If a user consistently finds themselves with insufficent Mana, they should get more $KOIN to meet their daily needs.

## 1 KOIN = 1 MANA
If you have 1 $KOIN, you also have 1 Mana. $KOIN can be broken down into what are commonly refered to as `satoshis`  which is equal to 0.00000001 $KOIN, which means Mana can also be broken down into the same increments.

This equivalency scales linearly too, such that if you have 100,000 $KOIN, you would also have 100,000 Mana. If you use 100,000 Mana in one transaction, you would also have caused 100,000 $KOIN to be temporarily locked. As Mana recharges each second, an equal amount of $KOIN is unlocked and freely available to transfer. The maximum recharge time is 5 days, while the minimum recharge time is 1 second.

# Mana Recharging

Mana recharge math is simple but you don't need to understand it to use it. This section is provided as a guide for technical users who want a deeper explanation.

1 $KOIN is able to recharge at 0.00000231 Mana/Second. Having 2 $KOIN doubles this rate and scales infintely. 

For example, if a user has 1,000 $KOIN,  their recharge rate is 1,000 x 0.00000231 Mana/Second or 0.00231 Mana/Second.

If this user performs a transaction that consumes 0.231 Mana, then they'll have 0.231 $KOIN locked which unlocks at a rate of 0.00231 $KOIN/sec. The total time to unlock all of the $KOIN will be 100 seconds.

To drive the point of scaling home, if this same user were to perform a transaction that consumes twice as much or 0.462 Mana, then they'll have 0.462 $KOIN locked which also unlocks at a rate of 0.00231 $KOIN/sec. The total time to unlock all of the $KOIN will be 200 seconds.

This means that the more $KOIN you hold, the more transactions you can perform within a shorter period of time. This encourages Mana to be pooled together and work collectively and why dApps should aim to gather enough Mana to be able to continuously fuel their operations.
