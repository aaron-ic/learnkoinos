# Direct Method

When a user holds $KOIN in their self custody wallet such as `koinos-cli` `Kondor Wallet`, `Portal Wallet`, `Koino` or `My Koinos Wallet`, they'll automatically have access to Mana, just like a charged car is always ready for an adventure. 

The user doesn't have to do anything and will be able to use the Koinos blockchain without losing their $KOIN to transaction fees.

Here is an example with Kondor Wallet. Youâ€™ll see that this wallet holds 186,709.727 $KOIN and it has access to an equivalent amount of Mana with a note saying `Mana Recharged`. 

This wallet can interact with any contract and  the Mana will recharge automatically after each transaction.

Next, we'll learn about Mana Sharing, one of the most powerful features of Koinos that will enable tokenless access and aid in mass adoption.
