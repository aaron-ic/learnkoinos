# Mana Sharing (Indirect Method)

Mana sharing is a native feature of the Koinos Blockchain that allows a user who does not have any $KOIN to use the Koinos blockchain, also known as "tokenless access". This indirect method of accessing Mana will allow millions of users who have no idea how to use blockchain, to experience its benefits with zero risk because anyone with $KOIN can share their mana!

Decentralized applications looking to expand their userbase will find Mana sharing especially interesting because they can attract no-coiners (users who don't hold any cryptocurrency at all), which was previously requried an extraordinary effort to onboard.

Mana sharing requires the user to upload a custom smart contract, but projects like Koinos Pro and Koinos Account Protocol (KAP) will both provide no code tools that makes this process simple and user friendly.

## How to Access Mana Sharing

As of April 2023, there are three interfaces being developed to make this feature easy to access. These interfaces will all be available within several months.

1. __Koinos Account Protocol__ is building `Mana Stations` which give KAP Usernames access to Mana automatically. This helps with anonymity since there is no trace of tokens being transfered and with accessibility since KAP offers a free username tier. [More On KAP](https://kap.domains)

2. __Koinos Pro__ is building `Mana Faucet` which gives dApps who subscribe to Koinos Pro access to Mana for their users. [More on Koinos Pro](https://koinos.io)


# Incentives to share Mana

There is no direct incentive to share Mana and this was purposely done to ensure maximum flexibility. Free market mechanics dictate how one can access Mana. If Mana is free, than the provider is likely benefiting in other ways. If Mana has a cost, the user has a choice to buy $KOIN or pay for access which results in Mana providers competiting to offer the lowest price possible.
