# WHAT IS MANA?

Mana is a property of the $KOIN token.

### NOTE: MANA HAS NO RELATIONSHIP WITH DECENTRALAND! MANA IS NOT A TOKEN!

The name Mana has deep roots, but most users are aware of the term from video games where users have a rate limited ability to run, recover heath, cast magic spells and so forth.

When the ability is limited, the user must "wait it out".

On Koinos, Mana is the ability to use the blockchain without losing tokens to fees. Their usage is rate limited based on how much Mana they have. The more $KOIN they hold, the more Mana they have.

## Understanding Mana With The Car Anology

A convenient way to think about Mana is comparing it to an electric vehicle. 

When someone drivse a typical gas powered car, they consume gas which needs periodic refueling. The larger the gas tank, the further they can drive, but they'll need to buy more gas. This is the typical Ethereum fee based model. Additionally, the cost of gas (priced in ETH) varies, making the model hard to manage for users.

Electric cars on the other hand are powered by electricity which can come from sustainable renewable sources. Bigger batteries allow us to drive further. This is the Koinos zero-fee model. Additionally, if we produce our own renewable energy, the cost of operation is zero making the model easy to manage for users.

When comparing Mana to Gas, the advantages of a Mana model is clearly more beneficial to the end user than Gas.

## Accessing Mana 
There are two ways users can access Mana:

1. Hold $KOIN (direct method).
2. Get Mana through sharing (indirect method)

Let's review how this works next.
