# WHAT IS MANA?

Mana is a property of the $KOIN token.

___Note: Mana on Koinos has no relationship with the decentraland token known as $MANA!___

The name Mana has deep roots, but most users are aware of the term from video games where users have a rate limited ability.

In games like Diablo, it's how frequently they can cast various magic spells. In games like Call of Duty, its the ability to recover health after getting shot and so forth. In both cases, Mana limits the usage of an otherwise unlimited resource by requiring the user to "wait it out".

## Understanding Mana With The Car Anology

If you don't play video games, we can use what we already know to understand Mana. Let's look at something we're all familiar with: cars.

When we drive our normal gas powered car, we consume gas which will eventually run out need refueling. Since we cannot produce our own gasoline, the usefulness of our car is limited to our accesss to gas stations. 

In blockchain, this is how gas fees typically work. The user will always seek to refuel their token supply so they can continuously use the blockchain.

Electric cars on the other hand, can be charged by renewable energy and can be fully self sustainable if we own our own generators powered by solar or wind. 

Holding $KOIN is identical to owning the whole production cycle of renewable energy, including the battery. This is how Mana works. Holding $KOIN will always give you access to Mana and you will always be able to generate more Mana.The greater their needs, the bigger their $KOIN holding should be, much like having a bigger battery for more range.

When comparing Mana to Gas, the advantages of a Mana model is clearly more beneficial to the end user than Gas.

## Accessing Mana 
There are two ways users can access Mana:

1. Hold $KOIN (direct method).
2. Get Mana through sharing (indirect method)

Let's review how this works next.
