# Accessing Mana

There are two ways users can access Mana:

1. Hold $KOIN (direct method).
2. Get Mana through sharing (indirect method)

## Holding $KOIN

When a user holds $KOIN in their self custody wallet, they'll automatically have access to Mana, just like charged car is always ready for adventure. 

There is no thinking involved, you just use the blockchain when you want to and after each transaction, Mana automatically begins recharging with no user input.

Here's a visual example of Kondor, a browser extension wallet for Koinos. Here, youâ€™ll see that this wallet holds 186,709.727 $KOIN and it has access to an equivalent amount of Mana. Use it, let it recharge and use it again. Rinse & repeat.

Next, we'll learn about Mana Sharing, one of the most powerful features of Koinos.
