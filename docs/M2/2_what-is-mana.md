# WHAT IS MANA?

Mana is a property of the $KOIN token.

___Note: Mana on Koinos has no relationship with the decentraland token known as $MANA!___

The name Mana has deep roots, but most users are aware of the term from video games where users have a rate limited ability.

In games like Diablo, it's how frequently they can cast various magic spells. In games like Call of Duty, its the ability to recover health after getting shot and so forth. In both cases, Mana limits the usage of an otherwise unlimited resource by requiring the user to "wait it out".

## Understanding Mana With The Car Anology

If you don't play video games, then learning by comparing to what we already understand is a great way to begin understanding Mana. Let's look at something we're all familiar with: cars.

When we drive our normal gas powered car, we consume gas which will eventually run out and we will need to refuel. Since we cannot produce our own gasoline, the usefulness of our car is tied to the gas pump. Even if we could produce our own gasoline, we would eventually run out of this resource globally.

In blockchain, this is how gas fees typically work. The user will always seek to replenish their token supply so they can continuously use the blockchain.

Electric cars on the other hand, can be charged by renewable energy that we can harness ourselves such as wind or solar. Negating for battery wear and tear, an electric car's energy source can be fully self sustainable if we own our own generators powered by solar or wind.

On the Koinos Blockchain, this is how Mana works. The user who owns $KOIN will always have Mana and will always be able to regenerate their Mana when they consume it. The greater their needs, the bigger their $KOIN holding should be, much like having a bigger battery for more range.


___Gas is non-renewable energy while Mana is the renewable opposite___

When you run out of tokens to buy gas on blockchain, you buy more tokens When you run out of Mana on the otherhand, you simply wait until your mana recharges.

When comparing Mana to Gas, the advantages of a Mana model is clearly more beneficial to the end user than Gas.
