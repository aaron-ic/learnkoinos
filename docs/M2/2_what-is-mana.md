# WHAT IS MANA?

Mana is a property of the $KOIN token.

___Note! Mana on Koinos has no relationship with the decentraland token known as $MANA.___

The name Mana has deep roots, but most users are aware of the term from video games where users have a rate limited ability.

In games like Diablo, it's how frequently they can cast various magic spells. In games like Call of Duty, its the ability to recover health after getting shot and so forth.

## The Energy Concept of Mana

If you don't play video games, then learning by comparing to what we already understand is a great way to begin understanding Mana. Let's look at something we're all familiar with, cars.

While driving a normal gas powered car, we will eventually run out of gas and need to refueled. If we are able to pump gasoline directly out of the ground, we would still eventually run out.

In blockchain, this is how gas fees typically work. The user will always seek to replenish their token supply so they can continuously  blockchain.

Electric cars on the other hand, can be charged by renewable energy such as wind, solar or geothermal. Negating for battery wear and tear, an electric car's energy source can be fully self sustainable.

On the Koinos Blockchain, this is how Mana works. The user will should be able to satisfy their needs by holding a specific amount of $KOIN and not have to constantly aquire more.


___Gas is non-renewable energy while Mana is the renewable opposite___

When you run out of tokens to buy gas on blockchain, you buy more tokens When you run out of Mana on the otherhand, you simply wait until your mana recharges.
