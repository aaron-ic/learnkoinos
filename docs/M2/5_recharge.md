# What happens after you use Mana?

Consuming Mana causes liquid $KOIN to be temporarily locked. Just like our car anology, if you ran out of juice in your electric car, you're going to have to sit and wait until it recharges enough to get you going again.

If a user consistently finds themselves with insufficent Mana, they should get more $KOIN.

# 1 KOIN = 1 MANA
If you have 1 $KOIN, you also have 1 Mana. And like Bitcoin, $KOIN can be broken down into a satoshi which is equal to 0.00000001 $KOIN. Mana can also be broken down into a satoshis.

This equivalency scales linearly. such that if you have 100,000 $KOIN, you would also have 100,000 Mana. If you use 100,000 Mana, you would ahve 100,000 $KOIN locked for 5 days.

# Mana Recharging

Mana math is simple but you really don't need to understand it to use it. This section is provided as a guide for technical users who want a deeper explination.

For each unit of Mana that is consumed, an equal amount of $KOIN is locked and cannot be transferred for as little as a few seconds to 5 days maximum. 

Locked $KOIN immediately begins to unlocked at the exact rate that Mana is recharging.

# Mana Automatically Recharges

1 $KOIN is able to recharge at 0.00000231 Mana/Second. Having 2 $KOIN doubles this rate and scales infintely. 

For example, if a user has 100,000 $KOIN, then their recharge rate is 100,000 x 0.00000231 Mana/Second or 0.231 Mana/Second.

If the user performs a transaction that consums 0.231 Mana, then they'll be able to recharge this amount in 1 second.

This means that the more $KOIN you hold, the more transactions you can perform within a shorter period of time. This encourages Mana to be pooled together and work collectively and why dApps should aim to gather enough Mana to be able to continuously fuel their operations.
