# INTRODUCTION

In this module, we'll cover everything you need to know about Mana for both users of dApps and developers. The goal of mana however, is to remove the usage anxiety and mental math casued by gas fees. 

On fee based blockchains such as Ethereum, users could pay a fee and still not get their transaction processed, thereby experience a real loss of the transaction fee with no result. Bare in mind, there are several blockchains that have zero fees, but none of them provide a true zero fee experience combined with a general purpose smart contract like Koinos. 

With Mana, no tokens are ever lost!

Developers should pay special attention to something called resource credits, otherwise know nas `rc` or `rclimits`. Resource Credits is the system that manages how much Mana is available to be consumed by any given wallet. The `koinos-cli` provides a powerful interface to manage `rc`, see [RC Limits](/M1/6_set-rclimit.md).

Let's begin the next section by understanding what Mana is first.
