# Mana Sharing (Indirect Method)

Mana sharing is a native feature of the Koinos Blockchain that allows a user who does not have any $KOIN to use the Koinos blockchain, also known as "tokenless access". This indirect method of accessing Mana will allow millions of users who have no idea how to use blockchain, to experience its benefits with zero risk.

Existing $KOIN holders will be able to help on board the next 1 million new-to-blockchain users who have never bought crypto, and they can do this without losing their tokens. 

Decentralized applications looking to expand their userbase will find Mana sharing especially interesting because they can attract the no-coiner audience, which was previously requried an extraordinary effort to onboard.

Mana sharing requires the user to upload a custom smart contract, but projects like Koinos Pro and Koinos Account Protocol (KAP) will both provide tools that makes this process simple and user friendly.
