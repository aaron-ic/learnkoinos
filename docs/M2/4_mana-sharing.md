# Mana Sharing

Mana sharing allows a user who does not have any $KOIN to use the Koinos blockchain, as though they did! This allows new-to-blockchain users to have “tokenless access”, which is the ability to begin using blockchain without having to buy and hold tokens first.

Mana sharing is a native feature of the Koinos blockchain and allows existing $KOIN holders to on board new-to-blockchain users who have never bought crypto, and they can do this without losing anything. 

Decentralized applications looking to expand their userbase will find Mana sharing especially interesting because they can attract a much wider audience.

In comparison, blockchains that utilize a fee based system must always require the user to acquire tokens to pay the gas fees.
